# Live Coding Interview Prep

This repository contains solutions to various coding problems typically encountered in live coding interviews. The goal is to practice solving these problems efficiently and with an optimal time complexity.

## Problems

- **Climbing Stairs**: Solution for the "Climbing Stairs" problem.
- **Fibonacci**: Solution for the Fibonacci problem.
- **Two Sum**: Solution for the "Two Sum" problem.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the problem directory (e.g., `climbing_stairs/`).
2. Run the solution using the following command:
3. Each problem folder contains a detailed explanation of the problem and the approach taken to solve it.

## Contributions

I will continue to add problems to here: if you want to add a problem to this repo, feel free to connect! I welcome contributions, whether it's solving new problems, improving existing solutions, or providing different approaches. Just create an issue or submit a pull request.

Let's collaborate and keep building this collection of coding challenges!
